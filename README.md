# Contentful CMS Project

This project is built using **Contentful CMS, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**.

## 📌 Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to store data using a **CMS (Contentful)** and retrieve it dynamically via the **Contentful CMS API**. This allows for easy content management and scalability.
