# Contentful CMS Project

This project is built using **React, Contentful CMS, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**.

## 📌 Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to store data using a **CMS (Contentful)** and retrieve it dynamically via the **Contentful CMS API**. This allows for easy content management and scalability.

## 🚀 Features

- **Content Management**: All project information is stored in Contentful CMS.
- **Data Fetching**: Retrieves and displays project data dynamically using the Contentful API.
- **Modern UI**: Styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and responsive design.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and maintainability.
- **React Components**: Modular and reusable UI components built with **React**.

## 📂 How It Works

1. Created a **content model** in **Contentful CMS** to store previously developed and published project details.
2. Used the **Contentful API** to fetch project data dynamically.
3. Developed a **React-based UI** to display the retrieved data in a structured format.
4. Styled the application using **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive and minimalistic design.
